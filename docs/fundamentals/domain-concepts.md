# ✍️ Domain Concepts

## Capital

The amount of money available in a trading account before taking any open positions.

#### Key Components

* **Equity:** The total value of the trading account, including unrealized profits or losses.
* **Free Margin**: The amount of equity not currently being used to maintain open positions.

## Leverage

Using borrowed capital to increase the potential return on investment. Just as leverage increases profits, the potential loss is just as significant.

#### Key Metrics

* **Leverage Ratio:** The ratio of borrowed funds to the trader's funds (e.g. 2000:1).
* **Buying Power:** The total value of assets that can be purchased with the borrowed and trader's funds.

## Margin

Margin is a special type of leverage that involves using existing cash or securities as collateral to increase one's buying power in financial markets.

#### Key Components

* **Initial margin:** The percentage of the total trade value that must be deposited by the trader to open a position.

$$
\text{Initial Margin} = \text{Capital} \times \text{Initial Margin Requirement}
$$

$$
\text{Initial Margin Requirement} = \frac{1}{\text{Leverage ratio}} \times 100\%
$$

* **Maintenance Margin**: The minimum amount of equity that must be maintained in a margin account to keep a position open. If the account equity falls below this level, the trader will receive a margin call from the broker.
* **Margin Call**: A demand from the broker for the trader to deposit additional funds to bring the account equity back to the required maintenance margin level. If the trader fails to meet the margin call, the broker may close out the trader's positions to limit further losses.

## Pip

The smallest price move that a given exchange rate can make. The monetary value of a one-pip move in the price of the asset is called a pip value.

## Lot Size

It is the standardized quantity of an asset in a trading contract.

## Risk Management

The process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance risk cost with trading objectives.

#### Key Strategies

* **Stop-Loss Order**: An order to sell an asset when it reaches a certain price to limit losses.
* **Take-Profit Order**: An order to sell an asset when it reaches a certain price to secure profits.
* **Risk-Reward Ratio**: The ratio of potential loss to potential gain in a trade.
* **Position Size**: The amount of capital to allocate to a particular trade.

## Profit-and-loss (PnL)

The gains or losses realized from trading activities.

#### Key Components

* **Realized PnL**: Profit or loss from closed positions.
* **Unrealized PnL**: Profit or loss from open positions.

## Market Order

It is an instruction given to a broker to buy or sell an asset at the best available price.

#### Types

* **Market Order**: An order to buy or sell immediately at the current market price.
* **Limit Order**: An order to buy or sell at a specified price or better.
* **Stop Order**: An order to buy or sell once the price reaches a specified level.

## Market Analysis

The study of market conditions to make informed trading decisions.

#### Types

* **Technical Analysis**: Using past price data and technical indicators to forecast future price movements.
* **Fundamental Analysis**: Evaluating an asset's intrinsic value based on economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors.

## Trading Strategy

A systematic method of buying and selling in the markets based on predefined rules and criteria.

#### Examples

* **Scalping**: Making multiple trades throughout the day to profit from small price movements.
* **Day Trading**: Buying and selling within the same trading day.
